# ABCD Notation

A super simple textual language to represent **music scores**. The aim is to be natural to use like **markdown** for writing documents. The positions of the musical elements in the text is close to their real positions in the score. Technically, this repository provides a program, that preprocesses the file to produce an ABC string, and then produces the output with the library abc.js.  The name ABCD is a hint to the abc notation.

# Motivation - Why?

## Why not graphical user interfaces?
In wysiwyg software, like Musescore, Finale, etc. you never know where to click.

## Why textual languages?
The only thing to learn with a textual language is the language. Everyone knows how to use a text editor. Existing textual langages (like abc and lilypond) are very powerful. 

## Why a new textual language?
Existing languages are difficult to use. The project aims at providing an easier to use textual language. Here are the main points:
- Both languages (ABC, Lilypond) have cryptic notations like `[K:bass]` or `\voice...`. In particular, adding a voice, a staff or lyrics is a bit tricky in both languages, while it is obvious in ABCD.
- Both in ABC and Lilypong, all the information concerning a single measure is spread out in the source.


# Basic example

A file containing

        𝄞 2/4    e'2   |  d'  r
        𝄢        r  c  |  c/ c/ c

produces the score
